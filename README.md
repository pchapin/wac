# Wac

This project is intended to be an Ada front end for Open Watcom. A serious attempt to build such
a front end is, of course a huge project and probably not feasible for one person to complete.
However, it sounds fun and interesting and that is good enough for now!

I also have a project that is an attemp to create a full Ada compiler in Scala that targets
LLVM. That project is even larger and more ambitious than this one! However, the two projects
have little else in common and share no code. Instead of Scala, this project is written in C++
1998 (actually the subset of C++ 1998 that is accepted by Open Watcom). This project also has no
code generator but is intended instead to connect to the Open Watcom code generator.
